Assignment

This assignment is to find all the genes in a DNA string and then store them using the StorageResource class.
 You will modify the program you wrote to find and print all genes, storing them instead of printing. 
 You should write and test each method on small data before moving on to the next step. 
 Then you will look for all the genes in a file and answer questions about them.

Specifically, you should do the following.

Make a copy of the printAll method called storeAll. 
Instead of printing the genes found, this method should create and return a StorageResource containing the genes found.
Write the void method named testStorageFinder. 
This method reads in the file brca1line.fa, which is a large string of DNA and calls storeAll to find and 
store all the genes in this large strand of DNA. It then prints the number of genes found. Note: 
You should first make sure this method works by using one of the small DNA strands above, 
and then replacing that with the DNA string from the file.
Write the method cgRatio that has one String parameter dna, 
and returns the ratio of C’s and G’s in dna as a fraction of the entire strand of DNA. 
For example if the String were “ATGCCATAG,” then cgRatio would return 4/9 or .4444444. 
(Hint: Recall the program that found all start tags, and use the same idea to find all C's and then G's.)
 (Another hint: 9/2 uses integer division because you are dividing
  an integer by an integer and Java thinks you want the result thus to be an integer. 
  If you want the result to be a decimal number, then make sure you convert one of the integers to a decimal number
   by changing it to a float. For example, (float) 9/2 is interpreted by Java as 9.0/2 and
    if one of the numbers is a decimal, then Java assumes you want the result to be a decimal number.
     Thus (float) 9/2 is 4.5.)
Write the void method printGenes that has one parameter sr, which is a StorageResource of strings. 
This method processes all the strings in sr and does the following:
prints all the Strings that are longer than 60 characters
prints the number of Strings that are longer than 60 characters
prints the Strings whose C-G-ratio is higher than 0.35
prints the number of strings whose C-G-ratio is higher than 0.35
In the method testStorageFinder, call printGenes with a StorageResource of the genes found from the file brca1line.fa, 
which you can download at http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/files.php under "All Example DNA Data,"
 or you can download a .zip file with several DNA data files by clicking here. 
 (Note that after you create a FileResource or URLResource,
  you can use the method asString to create a String variable of the file.)
